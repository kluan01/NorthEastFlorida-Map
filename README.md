## Features
- Downloads and processes road network graphs using OSMnx.
- Implements and compares Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for shortest path computation.
- Visualizes the road network and computed shortest paths.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or later
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## How to run:
1. Clone the repository & download the listed dependencies
2. Run the following command in the terminal: python main.py

### The script will:  
- Randomly select a start and target node.  
- Run both Dijkstra's and A* algorithms.  
- Display execution time, shortest path, and visualize the route.
